A simple cell for testing NMR in superfluid $^3$He. A Stycast-1266 cylindrical cell,
diameter 7.8~mm, height 10~mm, filling line 1~mm.

Copper cell leg was annealed at $900^\circ$C for 2h, brass spacer was
hard-soldered. Cleaning have been done in boiling water (to remove flux),
and then in boiling water with vinegar and baking soda to remove oxide. Note,
that brass became a copper-colored after soldering because Zn goes away.

Small quartz fork (32kHz) have been put into the cell leg about 1 cm from
its bottom. Cell leg have been glued into the cell with Stycast-1266.
Wires from the fork go through the glue.

Fork measurement at room temperature:\\
$P=1$~bar: $1/\tau=17.22$~1/s, $f=32743.76$~Hz\\
$P=0$~bar: $1/\tau=1.364$~1/s, $f=32750.69$~Hz

Two pairs of RF coils are mounted on a separate plastic holder. Each pair has 34+34 turns
of 70mkm(?) Cu wire. Copper wires are in thermal contact with the mixing chamber.
Measured inductance, capacitance and resistance (with ~30cm wires):\\
coil 1: $L = 55.6\,\mu$H, $C = 14.2$~pF, $R = 14.4\,\Omega$\\
coil 2: $L = 55.4\,\mu$H,  $C = 15.7$~pF,  $R = 14.6\,\Omega$\\
Mutual capacitance about 10~pF.

Calculated magnetic field in the center: 16.6~G/A.

RF coil forms a resonant circuit with a capacitor. A relay box (todo: text)
is used to switch the capacitance from 400 to 2400~pF.

Resonance curves measured at room temperature with a generator and a
lock-in, matlab script for fitting (not good):
\WWWFile{notes/2016-nmrmag/res300K.zip}. At frequency 800~kHz mutual inductance
and parasitic capacitance between coils compensates each other and
coupling goes to zero. This is an ideal situation for such
NMR coil design.

{\bf Drilling the cell (2018-01-18).} During glueing the cell filling line
was blocked. The filling line was drilled through the top wall of the cell,
then the hole was glued with a small GRP part.

{\bf RF-field calibration in the HPD experiment.} For $U_{\mbox{exc}}=1$~V
voltage on the coil is 0.05~V (HiZ mode of the generator + 20~dB
attenuator). Assuming the inductance~$L=55\,\mu$H and the
frequency~$f=1.120$~MHz one have the current~$I=0.13$~mA and field
$2.14$~mG/V in the center. Dimensionless field is $6.2\times10^{-6}$.
