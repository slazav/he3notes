NMR magnet for $^3$He experiments in DryDemag cryostat (summer 2016). The bottom flange
is connected to the nuclear demagnetization stage sinter volume. There is
a 6mm CuNi tube for soldering an experimental cell. The coil former is
thermally separated from the nuclear stage by Nb shield (Note: now the
lower part of the coil former is touching the shield. If one makes a
design with a gap there it will be much smaller heat leak through
niobium). The shield fully encapsulates the magnet. In the shield there
is a D6 hole for the cell leg, D3 and D4 screw holes near corners (where
marnetic field is small) and possible gap between Nb tube and top/bottom
plates.

The coil former and flanges have been made of oxigen-free copper in LTL
workshop and then annealed for 2 hours at 900$^\circ$C in
$2\cdot10^{-3}$~mbar of air (remove hidrogen, oxidize magnetic
impurities, anneal copper for better conductivity). Niobium parts have
been ordered in \Firmetal{} company (534\euro{} for the
$60\times1\times140$~mm tube, 153\euro{} for $65\times140\times1$~mm
plate).

\subsection*{Magnet winding}

Winding was done 20-21.9.2016. Before winding a plastic rod with
longitudinal grooves on the surface have been inserted in the coil former
to prevent its deformation. After winding it was removed by drilling.

{\bf Wire.} Vacryflux 5001. 54 NbTi filaments in Cu matrix; diameter:
$70\mu$m without isolation, $83-85\mu$m with isolation; Cu/NbTi ratio:
1.35/1; critical current: 2~A at 3~T, 1~A at 8~T; resistance at room
temperature $8.0\Omega/$m; bought from \Bruker. Stycast-1266 was used to
fill the coil.

{\it winding process}}

{\bf Main coil:} length 104~mm, inner diameter 42~mm. Winding:
5 layers: 1208+1197+1200+1203+1193 turns. Accurate everywhere except
~4mm edges (hard to move from one layer to another with such a thin
wire). Then flatten edges with 12mm Kapton. Then 3 layers 11.2mm (compensation + 6thlayer):
140+97+120 turns. Then middle part of the 6th layer: 939 turns. Then
3 layers 11.2mm (compensation + 6thlayer): 133+103+133 turns.
Number of turns in the compensation coils is the same on both sides,
but it is a bit smaller then it should be.


{\bf Quadratic coil.} $L=34.8$, 2 layers, 408+408 turns.
After the coil had been made, the solenid was fully covered with Kopton
tape, and then by two layers of white paper to make a flat surface for
next coils.

{\bf Gradient coil.} Start at 2mm from solenoid edges, L=41.8mm R=~21.5
1 layer, 514+482 turns (not so accurate andassymetric).
Then the central part was covered with red "yellow" tape to make it flat
for the next coil.

{\bf Forth-power coil.} 1 layer, 79+79 turns, 6.8mm + 14mm gap + 6.0mm
(very assymetric for some reason).

{\bf Connector:} plastic body + brass screws and nuts +
two-sided 0.4mm PCB (one side for contacts, another one for heat sink).
Wires are soldered to the connector at length 20-30cm (isolation was
removed in boiling NaOH).

\subsection*{Solenoid parameters}

Field profile, calculated and measured by shift of $^3$He NMR line:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Coil  &  Field [G/A] vs r,z [cm] & measured\\\hline
Main   &  $397.996$                       & $407.72$\\
Grad   &  $31.4270\ z$                    & $1.43 + ? z$\\
Quad   &  $105.958 - 15.240 f_2$$^{(1)}$  & $108.27 - ? f_2$\\
Helm   &  $16.6512 - 1.0351 f_4$$^{(2)}$  & $18.09 - ? f_4$\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent
(1) $f_2 = z^2-r^2/2$\\
(2) $f_4 = z^4 - 3 z^2 r^2 + 3/8 r^4$
\medskip

For comparison, Rota quadratic coil in magnon condensate experiments was $2.231 - 3.304 f_2$


Errors, calculated in cylindrical volumes with length = diameter 10 and 20 mm,
and measured by normal $^3$He NMR line width.

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Coil   & Err 20x20 & Err 10x10 & Err (measured) \\\hline
Main   & $1.4\cdot10^{-5}$ & $2.2\cdot10^{-6}$ & $\approx1\cdot10^{-4}$\\
Grad   & $1.5\cdot10^{-2}$ & $3.5\cdot10^{-3}$ & \\
Quad   & $4.9\cdot10^{-3}$ & $3.0\cdot10^{-4}$ & \\
Helm   & $1.8\cdot10^{-1}$ & $2.2\cdot10^{-1}$ & \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

Coil resistances:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
Main: & 7980~$\Omega$\\
Grad: & 1068~$\Omega$\\
Quad: & 861~$\Omega$\\
Helm: & 174~$\Omega$\\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

On the connector all coils are shortened by 100~$\Omega$ resistors to
provide LR filtering.
