Work reports and notes.
- Folders for each project.
- A tex file with all information and pictures.
- Supplementary files and folders with links from tex.

The idea is to have a complete pdf page with hyperlinks
which can be sent to any external person.

Update script put all files into SITE folder and syncronizes
it with my aalto page (https://users.aalto.fi/~zavyalv1/texts/)
