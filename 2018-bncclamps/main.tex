In CW NMR experiments with compensated signal unstable contact in BNC
connectors is a problem. Unfortunately, most of usual devices use such
connectors for signal lines. There are a few ways how one can deal with
this problem. In Dmitriev's group in Moscow all important connectors have
been replaced to TNC (a threaded version of the BNC). This needs
disassembling of devices and not always possible. In ROTA group in
Helsinki clamps have been used to attach BNC-to-SMA converters to all
connectors.

I am using similar clamps as in ROTA but simpler and cheaper. Clamps have
been ordered in \SchaefferAG{} company. Price was 332\euro{} for 20
aluminum clamps (two parts each). Aluminum is a bit too soft, one should
try thicker design or different metal. But clamps work pretty well.
